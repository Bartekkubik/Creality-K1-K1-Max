# INTRODUCTION
This is basically my original shroud except the blower has been lowered, added a mounting area for the Knomi and replaced the spring retainer on the carriage so you don't have to break off the USB-C port. I kept is as compact and as close to the original size as possible.

The Knomi and the shroud have a slight interference fit. Depending on how well your printer is tuned it should have a snug fit. You will also need to print the replacement spring retainer so the USB-C port fits and the guitar looking thingy that holds the Knomi in place with a M3x6mm BHCS screw.

Use the free port labeled 'FILAMENT' in the back of the toolhead PCB (pictured) to power the Knomi. Red wire coming from Knomi goes to 'V', black wire goes to 'G'.
