- Carriage is wider (to fit TBGS extruder)
- You will lose 7mm in the y axis (front of bed)
- You will need to comment out 'CX_NOZZLE_CLEAR' in the 'gcode_macro.cfg' as the nozzle hangs about 1mm past the bed in the rear
- You will need to edit your 'position_max' and 'mesh_max' as the nozzle hangs about 1mm past the bed in the rear
- Bottom left PCB screw will need a spacer
