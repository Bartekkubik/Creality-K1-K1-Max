## INTRODUCTION
I made this mod to help with heating the enclosure. It uses one or two 5015 24V blowers. I have the fans wired in parallel using the exhaust fan port since I don't use it (up to you). These bed fans were tested using an AC bed (110V, 500W) and the printer completely sealed. The bed fans can work with the factory bed/bed heater but it won't be as effective.

## IMPORTANT
 
 1. Consider this a WORK IN PROGRESS
 2. You are downloading/installing this mod willingly
 3. We are not reponsible/liable for any damage caused
 4. This mod was tested with an aftermarket bed/bed heater
 5. Keep wires away from the Z belt in the bottom compartment
 6. Fan Mounts need 8mm of clearance under the bed/bed heater
 7. Fan mounts might not be compatible with some screen hole sealers
 8. Have not been tested in the K1 Max. I don't see a reason why they wouldn't work
