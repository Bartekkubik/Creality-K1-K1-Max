# K1 Dual Fan Mod

# INTRODUCTION
I have ran dual 12032 blower fans in my Voron machines and wanted the same setup in my K1. So I made a dict for the left side.
Enjoy the extra cooling, faster overhang speeds and lower layer times :)

# INSTRUCTIONS
I taped both panels together and used the existing holes to drill the left panel

Make sure you orient the panels correctly before drilling because one of the corners on the blower fan does not have a screw hole

I made a Y splitter using JST connectors that way I could keep the factory wiring intact (pictured) 

I then ran the wires from the new blower up to the stepper motor and inside the cable raceway (pictured)
