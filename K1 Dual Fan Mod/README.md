# K1 Dual Fan Mod
![20230729_165214](https://github.com/DerrickDarrell/Creality-K1-K1-Max/assets/145330457/e123bd21-4dd9-4720-a3d2-4019fd4a4b33)

# INTRODUCTION
I have ran dual 12032 blower fans in my Voron machines and wanted the same setup in my K1. So I made a dict for the left side.
Enjoy the extra cooling, faster overhang speeds and lower layer times :)


If you like my work consider [buying me a ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/derrickdarrell) â˜•ðŸ˜Š Your support is greatly appreciated.



# IMPORTANT
1. This mod requires you to drill holes in the left panel
2. This mod might not be compatible with the K1 Max due to Lidar
3. This mod will require connecting electrical components onto existing wiring
4. If you don't know what you're doing, please ask someone who does
5. You are installing this mod willingly. I take no responsibility if you damage your machine or whatever worse may come of that


# BOM

# PRINT SETTINGS
- Supports needed (external only)
- 2 walls
- 4 top/bottom
- 20% infill


# INSTRUCTIONS
I taped both panels together and used the existing holes to drill the left panel

Make sure you orient the panels correctly before drilling because one of the corners on the blower fan does not have a screw hole

I made a Y splitter using JST connectors that way I could keep the factory wiring intact (pictured) 

I then ran the wires from the new blower up to the stepper motor and inside the cable raceway (pictured)
