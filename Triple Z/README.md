## **BOM**

3x - 16T 5mm Bore timing gears (10mm belt - tall)
2x - 136mm closed loop belts
1x - 132mm closed loop belt
1x - 20t 6mm bore timing gear (optional - for rear lead screw)
3x - nema 17 stepper motors (40Ncm or better)
M3 screws of various lengths


## **IMPORTANT**

1. You're doing this willingly
2. I am not responsible if you damage your printer or whatever worse may come of it
3. This requires you drilling through the bottom panel
4. This will not work with the factory board
5. Custom z joints are not necessary. The factory ones have enough flex to allow z tilt
6. If you use the stepperonline motors listed bellow, you might need to swap the middle pins
7. Use blue loctite on all timing gear grub screws
8. K1 Max users will need to upgrade their power supply
9. **If you don't know what you're doing and are asking a thousand questions, maybe you shouldn't be doing this**

## **OTHER INFO**

The 20T timing gears on the front lead screws need to be flipped around. This allows you to sit the gear and belt lower on the motor's shaft for better stability. 

You will need to setip Z tilt in klipper, check the link below
