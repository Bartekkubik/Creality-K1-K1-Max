# K1 SIDE BRACES

![300223062-4206561b-92dc-4dd4-9215-494771ae762e](https://github.com/DerrickDarrell/Creality-K1-K1-Max/assets/145330457/0c485eab-bf78-447b-b4fb-d8d81f361920)


# INTRODUCTION

I made these braces to strengthen the frame in the K1 3D printer.

From my previous versions I found out the panel likes to rattle against the printed part in the areas between the screws. You will need 1mm foam tape to prevent the panel rattling on the plastic (pictured)
